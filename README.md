<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setting up resources in Azure
- Testing connectivity between client and Domain Controller
- Installing Active Directory
- Creating Admin and end user accounts
- Joining client to domain
- Setting up remote desktop for non-administrative accounts
- Ensuring client can be logged into with end user accounts

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

</p>
<p>
To start, create a Resource Group and a VM named "DC-1". Set it to run on "Windows Server 2022". This VM will be used as a "Domain Controller".
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Next, set the VM's IP address to be static.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After, setup a new VM in the same resource group and virtual network named "Client-1". Set it to run on Windows 10.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Next, use remote desktop to log into Client 1. After, attempt to ping DC-1's private IP address (you can find this in the Azure portal).
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Login to the "Domain Controller" and enable ICMPv4 traffic using Windows Firewall.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Head back to Client-1 and check to see if the ping was successful.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Next, log back into DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Promote DC-1 to "Domain Controller", then setup a new forest named "mydomain.com".
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Restart DC-1 from the Azure portal, and log back in as ("mydomain.com\" + the username you used when creating DC-1). If your username was "labuser" for example, your new username would be "mydomain.com\labuser".
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
After setting up your forest, head over to Active Directory Users and Computers. Create two organizational units called "_EMPLOYEES" and "_ADMINS".
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Create a new employee account named "John Doe" with username "john_doe" and add this account to the "Domain Admins" security group.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log out of DC-1 and restart the VM from the Azure portal. Log back in as "mydomain.com\john_doe".
</p>
